#### ios-icons sort example

gdawg.lua contains an example script for sorting icons, and by example,
I mean this is how mine currently sort.

I don't like groups so my sort goes like this:

- flatten the list
- order by preference
- re-shape into pages

With groups the same process applies (connect/fetch/re-order/set) but
you'll need ensure the number of icons per page is within range yourself.
