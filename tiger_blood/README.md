Ths is where the interesting stuff lives.

It's not the safest of stuff, or the most polished stuff, or really
practical. But who needs practical when you've got 
[tiger blood](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Charlie_Sheen)?

## tiger blood

Did someone say tiger blood? Lets get on with the bi-winning!

    ios = require "ios-icons.tiger-blood"

require'ing this submodule instead of the norm one gets you a wrapped
version of the lib with extras.

### backups

Running pretty much any of the scripts in `7gramrocks` will overwrite
your icons, but run them anyway! just save a copy of your setup before
you melt your face. `icons:save_plist("winning_ep1c_win_.plist")`

See the 00_BACKUP... file in this dir for details. My success rate is 
100 percent. Do the math.
